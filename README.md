# Morpheus: Cypher for Apache Spark

---
**NOTE**

This project is no longer actively maintained.
If you want to know more, please reach out by creating an issue.

---

Morpheus extends [Apache Spark™](https://spark.apache.org) with [Cypher](https://neo4j.com/docs/developer-manual/current/cypher/), the industry's most widely used [property graph](https://github.com/opencypher/openCypher/blob/master/docs/property-graph-model.adoc) query language defined and maintained by the [openCypher](http://www.opencypher.org) project.
It allows for the **integration** of many **data sources** and supports **multiple graph** querying.
It enables you to use your Spark cluster to run **analytical graph queries**.
Queries can also return graphs to create **processing pipelines**.

**Note** This is the repo formerly known as opencypher/cypher-for-apache-spark

## Intended audience

Morpheus allows you to develop complex processing pipelines orchestrated by a powerful and expressive high-level language.
In addition to **developers** and **big data integration specialists**, Morpheus is also of practical use to **data scientists**, offering tools allowing for disparate data sources to be integrated into a single graph. From this graph, queries can extract subgraphs of interest into new result graphs, which can be conveniently exported for further processing.

Morpheus builds on the Spark SQL DataFrame API, offering integration with standard Spark SQL processing and also allows
integration with GraphX. To learn more about this, please see our [examples](https://github.com/opencypher/morpheus/tree/master/morpheus-examples).
 
<!-- TODO: WIKI How does it relate to GraphFrames -->
<!--- **Data Analysts**: -->
<!--  This example shows how to aggregate detailed sales data within a graph — in effect, performing a ‘roll-up’ — in order to obtain a high-level summarized view of the data, stored and returned in another graph, as well as returning an even higher-level view as an executive report. The summarized graph may be used to draw further high-level reports, but may also be used to undertake ‘drill-down’ actions by probing into the graph to extract more detailed information.-->

## Current status: Pre-release

The functionality and APIs are stabilizing but surface changes (e.g. to the Cypher syntax and semantics for multiple graph processing and graph projections/construction) are still likely to occur. 
We invite you to try out the project, and we welcome feedback and contributions.

If you are interested in contributing to the project we would love to hear from you; email us at `opencypher@neo4j.org` or just raise a PR. 
Please note that this is an openCypher project and contributions can only be accepted if you’ve agreed to the  [openCypher Contributors Agreement (oCCA)](CONTRIBUTING.adoc).

## Documentation

A preview of the documentation for Morpheus is [available from Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/docs/morpheus-user-guide/1.0-preview/).
-->
## Morpheus Features

Morpheus is built on top of the Spark DataFrame API and uses features such as the Catalyst optimizer.
The Spark representations are accessible and can be converted to representations that integrate with other Spark libraries.

Morpheus supports [a subset of Cypher](https://github.com/opencypher/morpheus/blob/master/documentation/asciidoc/cypher-cypher9-features.adoc) and is the first implementation of [multiple graphs](https://github.com/boggle/openCypher/blob/CIP2017-06-18-multiple-graphs/cip/1.accepted/CIP2017-06-18-multiple-graphs.adoc) and graph query compositionality.

Morpheus currently supports importing graphs from Hive, Neo4j, relational database systems via JDBC and from files stored either locally, in HDFS or S3.
Morpheus has a data source API that allows you to plug in custom data importers for external graphs.

## Morpheus Roadmap

Morpheus is under rapid development and we are planning to offer support for:
- a large subset of the Cypher language
- new Cypher Multiple Graph features
- injection of custom graph data sources

## Supported Spark and Scala versions

As of Morpheus `0.3.0`, the project has migrated to Scala 2.12 and Spark 2.4 series.
[As of Spark 2.4.1](https://spark.apache.org/releases/spark-release-2-4-1.html) Scala 2.12 is officially supported for Spark.
However, only Spark `2.4.2` uses Scala 2.12 for its prebuilt convenience binaries, which means that in order to use Morpheus with a later Spark version, one needs to build it manually.

## Get started with Morpheus
Morpheus is currently easiest to use with Scala. 
Below we explain how you can import a simple graph and run a Cypher query on it.

### Building Morpheus

Morpheus is built using Gradle

```
./gradlew build
```


#### Add the Morpheus dependency to your project
In order to use Morpheus add the following dependency:

Maven:

```
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.opencypher</groupId>
  <artifactId>morpheus-spark-cypher</artifactId>
  <version>0.4.2</version>
</dependency>
```

sbt:
```
libraryDependencies += "org.opencypher" % "morpheus-spark-cypher" % "0.4.2"
```

Remember to add `fork in run := true` in your `build.sbt` for scala projects; this is not Morpheus
specific, but a quirk of spark execution that will help 
[prevent problems](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44298847/why-do-we-need-to-add-fork-in-run-true-when-running-spark-sbt-application).

### Hello Morpheus

Cypher is based on the [property graph](https://github.com/opencypher/openCypher/blob/master/docs/property-graph-model.adoc) data model, comprising labelled nodes and typed relationships, with a relationship either connecting two nodes, or forming a self-loop on a single node. 
Both nodes and relationships are uniquely identified by an ID (Morpheus internally uses `Array[Byte]` to represent identifiers and auto-casts `Long`, `String` and `Integer` values), and contain a set of properties. 

The following example shows how to convert a social network represented by two DataFrames to a `PropertyGraph`. 
Once the property graph is constructed, it supports Cypher queries via its `cypher` method.

```scala
import org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame
import org.opencypher.morpheus.api.MorpheusSession
import org.opencypher.morpheus.api.io.{MorpheusNodeTable, MorpheusRelationshipTable}
import org.opencypher.morpheus.util.App

/**
  * Demonstrates basic usage of the Morpheus API by loading an example graph from [[DataFrame]]s.
  */
object DataFrameInputExample extends App {
  // 1) Create Morpheus session and retrieve Spark session
  implicit val morpheus: MorpheusSession = MorpheusSession.local()
  val spark = morpheus.sparkSession

  import spark.sqlContext.implicits._

  // 2) Generate some DataFrames that we'd like to interpret as a property graph.
  val nodesDF = spark.createDataset(Seq(
    (0L, "Alice", 42L),
    (1L, "Bob", 23L),
    (2L, "Eve", 84L)
  )).toDF("id", "name", "age")
  val relsDF = spark.createDataset(Seq(
    (0L, 0L, 1L, "23/01/1987"),
    (1L, 1L, 2L, "12/12/2009")
  )).toDF("id", "source", "target", "since")

  // 3) Generate node- and relationship tables that wrap the DataFrames. The mapping between graph elements and columns
  //    is derived using naming conventions for identifier columns.
  val personTable = MorpheusNodeTable(Set("Person"), nodesDF)
  val friendsTable = MorpheusRelationshipTable("KNOWS", relsDF)

  // 4) Create property graph from graph scans
  val graph = morpheus.readFrom(personTable, friendsTable)

  // 5) Execute Cypher query and print results
  val result = graph.cypher("MATCH (n:Person) RETURN n.name")

  // 6) Collect results into string by selecting a specific column.
  //    This operation may be very expensive as it materializes results locally.
  val names: Set[String] = result.records.table.df.collect().map(_.getAs[String]("n_name")).toSet

  println(names)
}
```

The above program prints:
```
Set(Alice, Bob, Eve)
```

More examples, including [multiple graph features](morpheus-examples/src/main/scala/org/opencypher/morpheus/examples/MultipleGraphExample.scala), can be found [in the examples module](morpheus-examples).

### Run example Scala apps via command line

You can use Gradle to run a specific Scala application from command line. For example, to run the `DataFrameInputExample` 
within the `morpheus-examples` module, we just call:

```
./gradlew morpheus-examples:runApp -PmainClass=org.opencypher.morpheus.examples.DataFrameInputExample
```
